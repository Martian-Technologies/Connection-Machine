# Propagation Delay

## Introduction

Propagation delay (or gate delay) is the time it takes for the output of a gate to reflect its inputs.  
This is naturally built into Connection Machine when vizualizing how an input propagates throughout the circuit.  However, currently all delays are considered to be the same and does not take into account the addition of clocks.
Propation delay generally happens in digital circuits due to the "slew rate" for MOSFET's.  The most comment form of logic gates are made using CMOS technology.  Below we show the gate implementation of an AND gate.
