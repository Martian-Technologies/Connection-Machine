# High Z Documentation 

## Introduction

## High-Z Explanation

### What is High Z

In logic circuits, states refer to the binary conditions that a siganl can be in, where on and off is usually represented in binary as 1 and 0 respectively.

"High Z" in particular refers to a high impedance state - where the output is neither a high (1) nor low (0). This would cause no signal to be driven, essentially acting like an open circuit.

This state is typically associated with a "tri-state logic" where a circuit can output a logical high, a logical low, or a high impedance state. 

### Why does High Z happen

Current flows down path with least resistance. Since High Z occurs when a circuit or component has a very high resistance to the flow of electrical current, it essentially acting like an open circuit. 

In the case of logic circuit simulations, the state would occur in conjunction with tri-state buffers. 

### Effects of High Z on a complex circuit

### Application of High Z

High Z states are particularly useful in situations where multiple devices need to communicate on a shared bus (a shared physical pathway between electronic components). By setting their outputs to high Z when not actively transmitting data, devices avoid interfering with each other, allow other output
